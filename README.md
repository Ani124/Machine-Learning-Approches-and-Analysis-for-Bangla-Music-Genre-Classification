# Machine-Learning-Approches-and-Analysis-for-Bangla-Music-Genre-Classification

This repository contains code for classifying Bangla music genres using various machine learning techniques. The steps involved in the code are as follows:

1. **Loading the Dataset:**
   The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afifaniks/bangla-music-dataset). The dataset comprises audio features of Bangla songs across different genres.

2. **Dataset Visualization:**
   Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of different music genres.

3. **Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   Data preprocessing steps are performed, which may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Feature Scaling:**
   The dataset features are scaled or normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process.

5. **Model Training and Result Analysis:**
   Several machine learning models (XGboost, GBM, CatBoost) are trained using the processed dataset. The models' performance metrics are analyzed to evaluate their effectiveness in classifying Bangla music genres.
